# Project Title:
Tic Tac Toe

## Team:
Jonathan Evans

## Project Objective:
This project aims to succesfully simulate the game of Tic Tac Toe over a network connection between a server and two clients.

## Scope:
Inclusions:
- Two clients will be able to connect to a server host.
- Clients will be able to engage in a game of Tic Tac Toe.
- The game will be displayed and interacted with within a terminal window.

Exclusions:
- The server will only handle two clients.
- The server will only handle one iteration of a game.

## Deliverables:
- Server Logging
- Synchronized game-state between server and clients
- Enforced turns between clients
